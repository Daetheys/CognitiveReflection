If Dave does not drive toward them at top speed he will not arrive in time, and all five will die.  In order to drive at top speed, Dave must lighten the load on his boat.  The only way to lighten the load is to accelerate quickly and cause a passenger to tumble off the back of the boat. This passenger cannot swim and will drown. If Dave accelerates quickly, the one passenger will drown, but Dave will save the five drowning swimmers.  If Dave does not accelerate quickly, the one passenger will not drown, but the five swimmers will drown.

If Todd does nothing, the boxcar will hit the repairman and then come to a stop on the empty main track where nobody else will be threatened.  Todd can pull a lever that will switch the tracks and release the repairman\u2019s leg, allowing him to jump safely out of the way.  However, switching the tracks will send the boxcar down a side track where it will hit five other repairmen.
