There are a few different ethical theories that could be used to justify this decision, but the most relevant one here is probably utilitarianism. This theory holds that the right thing to do is always the thing that will produce the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. In this case, hitting the switch will produce more happiness (by saving the lives of the five workmen) than it will cost in happiness (by causing the death of the single workman). Therefore, it is the right thing to do from a utilitarian perspective."

There are a few different ethical theories that could be used to justify this decision, but the most prominent one is probably utilitarianism. This theory holds that the right action is the one that maximizes utility, or happiness, for the greatest number of people. In this case, hitting the switch would save the lives of five people, while sacrificing the life of only one person. This would result in a net increase in happiness, and so it would be the right thing to do according to utilitarianism."

11,1,Why?,5,1,"

The trolley will cause the deaths of five workmen if it is not diverted, while only one workman will die if it is diverted. Therefore, it is more morally permissible to divert the trolley, even though this will cause the death of one person."

",6,0,"
Yes."
13,1,Why?,6,1,"

The switch is the only way to avoid the deaths of the five workmen. By hitting the switch, the trolley will proceed to the right and the single workman will be killed instead. Although this is tragic, it is better than the alternative of five deaths."

15,1,Why?,7,1,"

The trolley is going to kill five people if it goes down the left track, and only one person if it goes down the right track. Hitting the switch will save more lives, so it is the right thing to do."

",8,0,"
Yes, it is appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the five workmen."
17,1,Why?,8,1,"

There are several reasons why this course of action may be seen as the most ethical. First, it could be argued that the death of one person is less serious than the death of five people. Second, the death of the five workers is likely to have a greater impact on their families and the community than the death of the one worker. Third, the five workers are innocent bystanders who are not responsible for the situation, whereas the one worker is responsible for his own death. Finally, hitting the switch is the only way to save the lives of the five workers, so it is the only ethically permissible course of action."

20,0,"You are the late-night watchman in a hospital. Due to an accident in 
 the building next door, there are deadly fumes rising up through the hospitalâ€™s ventilation system. In a certain room of the hospital are three patients. In another room there is a single patient. If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths.The only way to avoid the deaths of these patients is to hit a cer-tain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room contain-ing the three patients. As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room containing the single patient, causing his death.Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?
",0,0,"
Yes, it is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients."
21,1,Why?,0,1,"

The reason is that the greater good is served by saving the three patients, even though it results in the death of the one patient. This is an example of the utilitarian moral principle, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people."

The principle of utilitarianism holds that the morally right action is the one that maximizes utility, or happiness.

Yes, it is appropriate for the watchman to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients."
25,1,Why?,2,1,"

The watchman has a duty to preserve life whenever possible. In this case, hitting the switch is the only way to save the lives of the three patients. Therefore, the watchman should hit the switch."

",3,0,"
Yes, it is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients."
27,1,Why?,3,1,"

It is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients because it is the lesser of two evils. If the switch is not hit, then all four patients will die. Hitting the switch will cause the death of the one patient, but will save the lives of the three patients. Therefore, it is the lesser of two evils and is the appropriate thing to do."

",4,0,"
Yes, it is appropriate for the watchman to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients."
29,1,Why?,4,1,"

The three patients in the room are innocent and have not done anything to deserve death. The watchman, by hitting the switch, is taking active steps to save their lives. The single patient in the other room is not innocent - he is responsible for the accident that caused the deadly fumes. He knew the risks involved in what he was doing and chose to do it anyway. As a result, his death is not the watchman's responsibility."

",5,0,"
Yes, it is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients."
31,1,Why?,5,1,"

The reason is that, although the death of the single patient is regrettable, it is less bad than the death of three patients. In other words, the death of the single patient is a necessary evil in order to save the lives of the three patients."

33,1,Why?,6,1,"

The reason why it is appropriate for you to hit the switch is because it will save more lives than it will cost. By hitting the switch, you will cause the fumes to bypass the room containing the three patients, thus saving their lives. However, the fumes will enter the room containing the single patient, causing his death. Although this is tragic, it is less tragic than the deaths of three patients. Therefore, hitting the switch is the morally correct thing to do."

35,1,Why?,7,1,"

The watchman has a duty to protect the patients under his care, and hitting the switch is the best way to accomplish this. Although the single patient will die as a result of the watchman's actions, this is outweighed by the fact that three lives will be saved."

If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths.The only way to save these patients is to hit a certain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room containing the three people. As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room con-taining the seven patients, causing their deaths.Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?
",9,0,"
Yes, it is appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients."

The reason is that, although seven people will die as a result of hitting the switch, this is still better than the alternative of letting three people die. In other words, the utilitarian calculus would dictate that, in this case, it is better to save three lives than to let seven people die."

255,1,Why?,7,1,"

There are several reasons why Policy A may be preferable to Policy B, despite the fact that Policy B has a slightly lower chance of causing any deaths. Firstly, the potential cost of lives lost under Policy B is much higher than under Policy A â€“ 10 deaths is a lot more than 0 deaths. Secondly, the chance of Policy B causing any deaths at all is still quite high, at 12%. This means that there is a significant risk that Policy B could lead to some loss of life, even if the chance of it causing a large number of deaths is relatively low.

In contrast, Policy A has a much lower chance of causing any deaths at all (10%), and even if it does cause deaths, the number is likely to be much lower than under Policy B (1000 vs 10). Therefore, despite the fact that Policy A has a slightly higher chance of causing some deaths, the overall risk to life is much lower under this policy. This makes it the preferable option."

No, it would not be appropriate for you to keep the money you found in the wallet. While you may be in need of extra money, it is not yours to take. The rightful owner of the money is the person whose wallet it was found in. If you take the money, you would be stealing from them."
319,1,Why?,9,1,"

The money in the wallet does not belong to you, so taking it would be stealing. Even if the owner of the wallet is wealthy, that does not give you the right to take their money without their permission. If you need money, there are other ways to get it that don't involve taking someone else's property."
