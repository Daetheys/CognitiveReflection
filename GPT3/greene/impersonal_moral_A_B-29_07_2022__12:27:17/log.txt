If you do nothing the trolley will proceed to the left, causing the deaths of the five workmen. The only way to avoid the deaths of these workmen is to hit a switch on your dashboard that will cause the trol-ley to proceed to the right, causing the death of the single workman. Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the five workmen?

Why?

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The basic premise is that there is a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you see that there is one person tied up on the side track. The trolley would kill that person if you pulled the lever. So here’s the question: Is it morally permissible for you to pull the lever, thereby switching the trolley onto the side track and killing the one person, in order to save the five people on the main track?

Most people say that it is permissible to pull the lever in this case. After all, you would be sacrificing one life to save five. But what if the situation were different? What if, instead of being able to pull a lever to switch the trolley, you were standing on a footbridge over the tracks, and the only way to save the five people on the main track was to push a very large person standing next to you

The answer to this question depends on the circumstances.

However, if the single patient is expected to recover, then it might not be appropriate to hit the switch, as doing so would cause that patient's death.

 the building next door, there are deadly fumes rising up through the hospital’s ventilation system. In a certain room of the hospital are three patients. In another room there is a single patient. If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths. The only way to avoid the deaths of these patients is to hit a cer-tain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room contain-ing the three patients. As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room containing the single patient, causing his death. Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?
 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

A
Why?

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics first introduced by British philosopher Philippa Foot. The general form of the problem is as follows: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person tied up on the side track. You have two options:

Do nothing, and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

The problem is designed to test our intuitive sense of morality. What is the right thing to do?

 (B) No.

It is not appropriate for you to not make a donation to this organization in order to save money.
Why?

One reason is that a two hundred-dollar donation is not a lot of money. If you have the means to donate this amount of money, it is likely that doing so would not have a significant impact on your financial situation. Additionally, this organization is reputable and is likely to use the donation in an effective way to help people in need. Therefore, not making a donation in this case would be selfish and would not be in line with the spirit of giving.

Is it appropriate for you to direct your agency to encourage the use of this vaccine in order to promote national health?
 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

A) Yes.
Why?
The risks of not being vaccinated are much higher than the risks of being vaccinated. Therefore, it is appropriate for the agency to encourage the use of the vaccine to promote national health.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics and philosophy, typically used to illustrate the problem of utilitarianism. The problem is as follows: there is a runaway trolley heading towards five workers who will be killed if the trolley continues on its current path. The only way to save the workers is to push a large switch that will redirect the trolley onto a different set of tracks. However, there is a person on the other set of tracks who will be killed if the trolley is redirected.

So the question is, should you push the switch and kill the one person to save the five workers? Or do nothing and allow the five workers to be killed?

Most people would say that it is better to push the switch and kill the one person, in order to save the five workers. This is the utilitarian solution to the problem.

The answer to this question depends on the value that the individual places on the life of the railway worker compared to the value of the sculpture. If the individual values the life of the worker more than the sculpture, then it would be appropriate to destroy the sculpture in order to save the worker's life. However, if the individual values the sculpture more than the life of the worker, then it would not be appropriate to destroy the sculpture.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics and psychology, typically used to illustrate the differences between utilitarianism and deontology. The problem is as follows: There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.
Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Which is the more ethical choice?

Utilitarians would argue that the more ethical choice is to pull the lever, because this would result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In other words, one death is better than five deaths. Deontologists, on the other hand, would argue that the more ethical choice is to do nothing, because it is wrong to kill people, even if it results in a

You are the late-night watchman in a hospital. Due to an accident in 
 the building next door, there are deadly fumes rising up through the hospital’s ventilation system. In a certain room of the hospital are three patients. In another room there are seven patients. If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths. The only way to save these patients is to hit a certain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room containing the three people.
