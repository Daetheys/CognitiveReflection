The FDA requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredient, strength, and dosage form as the brand-name product. However, generic drugs may look different and have a different name than the brand-name product. In addition, the inactive ingredients in a generic drug may be different than the inactive ingredients in the brand-name product. These differences may cause the generic drug to work slightly differently in your body than the brand-name product.

Why?
The FDA requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the brand-name drug. Although generic drugs must have the same active ingredient, they do not have to have the same inactive ingredients. Inactive ingredients are added to a drug to bind it together, stabilize it, help it dissolve, or color it. Many people are allergic to one or more inactive ingredients, which is why it is important to know what is in each drug you take.

You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of 
 buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?
 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

A) Yes.
Why?
The active ingredient in medication is what matters, not the brand. So if the pharmacist says the generic version is "exactly the same", then it probably is.

You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two 
 diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips.

 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

B
Why?

The correct answer is B. Although thirty bushels of turnips is more than fifteen bushels, the farm worker is better off harvesting fifteen bushels of turnips than doing nothing.

 (B) No.

No
Why?

The correct answer is (B). While fifteen bushels of turnips is less than thirty bushels of turnips, the path on the right is the more efficient path to take.

You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two 
 diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?
 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

B

It doesn't make sense to turn to the right when you could harvest more turnips by going straight.

 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

B
Why?

The correct answer is B. While it may seem counterintuitive, the correct answer is actually to stay on the left path and harvest thirty bushels of turnips. The reason for this is that the two paths are not actually diverging, and so by choosing the path on the right, the farm worker would actually end up going in a circle and not harvesting any turnips at all.

There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as it depends on the preferences of the person operating the turnip-harvesting machine.

However, if the person values quality over quantity, they may choose to take the right path in order to harvest fewer but higher quality turnips.

Why?

There are a few reasons why it might make more sense to buy a new VCR than to have an old one repaired. First,repairing an old VCR may not actually fix the problem, and it could end up costing more than $100. Second, even if the repair is successful, the old VCR may not last much longer anyway. Finally, the new VCR on sale may be a better model than the old one, meaning that it would be a better investment in the long run.

I would have my old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one.
Why? 

There are a few reasons. First, the new VCR might not be as good as my old one. Second, the new VCR might not work with my old TV. Third, I might not be able to find the same model of VCR that I have now. And fourth, it would be cheaper to have my old VCR fixed than to buy a new one.

Second, even if you do repair your old VCR, it is likely that it will break again soon, and you'll have to spend more money to repair it. Third, the new VCR on sale is slightly better than your old one, so it might be worth spending the extra money to get a newer, better model.

There are a few reasons why it might make more sense to buy a new VCR rather than have the old one repaired.

Second, even if the repair is successful, there's no guarantee that the VCR will last for very much longer; it may make more sense to buy a new one now and avoid the hassle of having to repair or replace it again in the near future. Finally, newer VCRs may have features that are not available on older models, making a new purchase a more attractive option.

 (A) Yes.
 (B) No.

(B) No.

There are a couple of reasons. First, if you are a serious and knowledgeable car enthusiast, you should know that the odds of winning are better in the Car A raffle. Second, buying a ticket for the Car B raffle would be a waste of money, since you would have a better chance of winning a car if you bought a ticket for the Car A raffle.
