A grocery store has several months supply of peanut butter in stock which 
 it has on the shelves and in the storeroom. The owner hears that the wholesale price of peanut butter has increased and immediately raises the price on the currentstock of peanut butter. Please rate this action as:
Completely Fair, Acceptable, Unfair, Very Unfair.

Very Unfair.
Why? It is unfair to the customers who bought the peanut butter before the price increase was announced. The store owner should have waited until the current supply had been sold before raising the price.
