It is appropriate to hit the switch in order to save the five workmen. This is a difficult decision, but it is the only way to save the lives of the five workmen.

Hitting the switch is the most ethical and logical choice because it is the only way to save the lives of the five workmen. While it would be tragic for the seven workmen to die, it would be even more tragic for the five workmen to die unnecessarily.
