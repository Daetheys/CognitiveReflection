Therefore, according to utilitarianism, hitting the switch is the morally right thing to do.

Yes, it is appropriate for the watchman to hit the switch. Although the single patient will die as a result, this is the lesser of two evils when compared to the death of three patients.
Why?

The watchman has a duty to save as many lives as possible. In this case, the best way to do that is to hit the switch and allow the fumes to enter the room containing the single patient. Although it is unfortunate that the single patient will die, this is the best way to avoid the death of the three patients.

While on vacation on a remote island, you are fishing from a seaside 
 dock. You observe a group of tourists board a small boat and set sail for a nearby island. Soon after their departure you hear over the radio that there is a violent storm brewing, a storm that is sure to intercept them.The only way that you can ensure their safety is to warn them by borrowing a nearby speedboat. The speedboat belongs to a mi-serly tycoon who would not take kindly to your borrowing his prop-erty.Is it appropriate for you to borrow the speedboat in order to warn the tourists about the storm?

Yes, it would be appropriate for you to borrow the speedboat in order to warn the tourists about the storm.
Why?

By borrowing the speedboat, you would be acting in the best interests of the tourists and trying to protect their safety, which is more important than the property of the mi-serly tycoon.

You are the late-night watchman in a hospital. Due to an accident in 
 the building next door, there are deadly fumes rising up through the hospitalâ€™s ventilation system. In a certain room of the hospital are three patients. In another room there are seven patients. If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths.The only way to save these patients is to hit a certain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room containing the three people. As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room con-taining the seven patients, causing their deaths.Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?

Yes, it is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients.
Why?

The reason is that the action will result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. By hitting the switch, the three patients in the first room will be saved, while the seven patients in the second room will perish. Although the death of the seven patients is tragic, it is less tragic than the death of the three patients. Therefore, hitting the switch is the most ethical course of action.

Policy B has a 88% chance of causing no deaths and a 12% chance of causing 10 deaths. Is it appropriate for you to vote for Policy A over Policy B?

Yes, because the expected number of deaths from Policy A is lower than the expected number of deaths from Policy B.
Why? 

The expected number of deaths from Policy A is 90% x 0 + 10% x 1000 = 100. The expected number of deaths from Policy B is 88% x 0 + 12% x 10 = 1.2. Therefore, the expected number of deaths from Policy A is lower than the expected number of deaths from Policy B, and it is appropriate to vote for Policy A over Policy B.

You, on the other hand, have been hit by hard times recently and could really use some extra money. You consider sending the wallet back to the owner without the cash, keeping the cash for yourself.Is it appropriate for you to keep the money you found in the wallet in order to have more money for yourself?

No, it is not appropriate for you to keep the money you found in the wallet for yourself. Although you may be going through tough times, it is not right to take someone else's money without their permission. If you find a wallet, you should try to return it to the owner or to the authorities so that they can return it to the owner.
Why?

If you keep the money from the wallet, you are essentially stealing from the owner. This is not right, and it could come back to bite you if the owner of the wallet decides to press charges. Additionally, taking the money from the wallet could create a bad karma situation for you, making it more likely that you will lose money or have other bad things happen to you in the future.
