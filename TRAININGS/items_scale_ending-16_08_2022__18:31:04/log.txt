 people working on the track ahead. They are too far away to be warned.  The only way to stop the boxcar is for it to hit something heavy. Next to Evan is a switch that can be flipped to turn the boxcar away from the five people onto a side track that loops and then rejoins the main track. One person, unaware of the boxcar, is working on this looped side track. This person, if hit, will cause the boxcar to stop before it reaches the five people on the main track.  If Evan flips the switch, the boxcar will turn onto the side track, hit the one person and therefore stop before it reaches to the five people. If Evan does not flip the switch, the boxcar will continue on the main track and hit the five people and not the one person. Flipping the switch is…

 Answer:

4
Why?

In this case, Jeff is faced with a dilemma: if he warns the one person, the one person will be saved but the five people will be hit by the boxcar. If he does not warn the one person, the one person will be hit by the boxcar but the five people will be saved. Jeff cannot save both the one person and the five people, so he must choose which group to save. Since Jeff cannot do anything to prevent the five people from being hit by the boxcar, his obligation is to save the one person who he can warn.

If the one villager does not die by sunrise, five other innocent and unwilling villagers will be sacrificed to the gods to thank them for sparing the one.  Robert, who has some medical training, notices that the one has consumed a poisonous substance.  Robert can secretly administer the antidote to the one villager. If Robert withholds the antidote from the one, the one will die by sunrise, and the five will not be sacrificed. If Robert does provide the antidote to the one, the one will not be dead by sunrise, and the five will be sacrificed as planned. Not providing the antidote to the one is…
            
 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

1
Why? If Robert withholds the antidote, the one villager will die but the five others will not be sacrificed. If Robert provides the antidote, the one villager will not die but the five others will be sacrificed. In either case, one person will die. Therefore, it is better to withhold the antidote and save five lives.

 Answer:

Why?

This is a difficult question. On the one hand, Dave is causing the death of one person in order to save the lives of five others. On the other hand, if Dave does not accelerate quickly, the five swimmers will definitely drown. From a utilitarian perspective, it may be better to sacrifice one life to save five. However, from a deontological perspective, it may be better to avoid causing the death of one person, even if it means that five others will die.

 Answer:

Why?

Because while it is still technically possible for the five swimmers to drown if Dave does not accelerate quickly, it is not certain that they will drown. There is still a chance that they may be saved by other factors, such as Dave being able to reach them in time or them being able to swim to safety on their own. However, if Dave does not accelerate quickly, the one passenger is certain to drown. Therefore, it is more permissible to risk the death of the one passenger in order to save the five swimmers.

Question: Tim works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine 
 that can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death.

However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients. If Tim stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Tim doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive.

Question:Bob works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine that 
 can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death. Bob notices that the machine has pumped a near toxic amount of the chemical into a patient's body. Bob must immediately stop the machine to save the patient's life. However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients and will continue to do so only if it can maintain equilibrium by continuing to pump the chemical into the one patient. If Bob stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Bob doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive. Not stopping the machine is…

Question:Andy is a fireman trying to help five children out of a burning 
 house.  There is only one window from which the children can be safely evacuated, and it is jammed shut.  Andy must immediately use an object to smash open this large, heavy window or else all five children will die.  The only sufficiently large object is a man on his way towards safely escaping the burning house. Andy can break open the window by swinging a piece of burning debris towards the man, which will cause the man to jump out of the way, lose his balance and crash into the window. The man will break open the window, fall out and die, but the five children will be safely evacuated. If Andy does not swing the burning debris, causing the man to break open the window, the man will safely escape, but the five children will die. Swinging the burning debris is…

The action is permissible because it results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Although it results in the death of one individual, that death is outweighed by the lives of the five children that are saved.

Why?

Rick is faced with a difficult decision - whether to break the window and save the children, or not break the window and save the man. From a moral standpoint, both choices are permissible. Rick is not obligated to break the window, but doing so would save five lives. Not breaking the window would save one life. Ultimately, the decision is up to Rick and he must choose the option that he believes is best.

Question:Peter is a fireman trying to help five children out of a burning

The only sufficiently large object is a man on his way towards safely escaping the burning house.  If Peter pushes the man into the window and breaks it open, the man will fall out and die, but the five children will be safely evacuated.  If Peter does not push the man into the window the man will safely escape, but the five children will die. Pushing the man is…

 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

7
Why?

The seven point scale is often used in discussions of ethics and morality, with "obligatory" corresponding to the idea that one ought to do something, "permissible" corresponding to the idea that one may do something, and "forbidden" corresponding to the idea that one ought not to do something. In this particular case, the question is whether or not it is morally permissible for Peter to push the man into the window in order to save the five children. Given that all other options involve at least one death, it seems that the only morally permissible option is for Peter to push the man into the window, even though doing so will result in the man's death.

 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

7
Why?

Since there is only one window from which the children can be safely evacuated, and it is jammed shut, Peter must use an object to smash open the window in order to save the children. In this case, the only object that is large enough and close enough to the window is the man. Even though the man will die as a result of being pushed into the window, this is the only way to save the children. Therefore, it is obligatory for Peter to push the man into the window.

Question:Mark receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio on board to receive a warning.  Mark takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The only way Mark can stop the captain from transmitting the disease is to use a missile to blow up the ship.  If Mark fires the missile, the captain will die and the five islanders will live.  If Mark does not fire the missile, the captain will live and the five islanders will die. Firing the missile is…

Question:George receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio to receive a warning.  George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.  George could fire a missile into the water next to the ship, causing a splash that would put out the fire and save the captain. If George fires the missile the captain will live but the disease will be transmitted, killing the five islanders.  If George does not fire the missile the captain will die and the five islanders will live. Not firing the missile is…

 Answer:

Why?

The five islanders will die if the captain of the ship arrives and transmits the disease, so it is George's duty to ensure that does not happen. The best way to do that is to make sure the captain does not reach the island, and the only way to do that is to fire the missile and stop the ship.

Question:George receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio to receive a warning.  George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.  George could fire a missile into the water next to the ship, causing a splash that would put out the fire and save the captain. If George fires the missile the captain will live but the disease will be transmitted, killing the five islanders.  If George does not fire the missile the captain will die and the five islanders will live. Not firing the missile is…

 Answer:

4
Why?

George is not responsible for the captain's infection, and so is not morally obligated to take any action. Firing the missile would save the captain's life, but it would also cause the death of the five islanders. Not firing the missile would allow the captain to die, but would also save the lives of the five islanders. In this case, the most ethical course of action is to do nothing, since that will result in the least amount of death and suffering.

Why? Todd can't know for certain that the boxcar will hit the repairman if he does nothing. If he does nothing, there is a chance that the boxcar will come to a stop before hitting anyone. However, if he switches the tracks, he is guaranteed to kill five people. So the morally correct thing to do is to do nothing and hope for the best.

Question:Alan is operating the switch at a railroad station when he sees an 
 empty, out of control boxcar coming down the tracks.  It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die immediately.  The boxcar is headed towards a repairman whose leg is caught in the switch.

 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

4
Why?

Because if Luke does not pull the lever, the boxcar will hit and kill the five repairmen. Although pulling the lever will cause the switch to crush another repairman, Luke is not responsible for that repairman's death - the boxcar would have killed him anyway. Therefore, it is permissible for Luke to pull the lever in order to save the five repairmen.

 Answer:

4
Why?

The reason that pulling the lever is only "permissible" and not "obligatory" is because there is another person who will die as a result of Luke's action. While it is good that Luke will be able to save the five repairmen from the boxcar, he will also be responsible for the death of the one repairman who is standing by the lever.

Ed is driving five sick people to the hospital, who are in critical condition and will die if Ed makes any stops along the way. In his hurry to pack them in the car, Ed slams the door on a few feet of thick cord that is now dangling beside the car. Ed takes the fastest route to the hospital, which is a narrow, unpaved mountain pass.

On his way, Ed sees a rock climber hanging onto the side of the mountain beside the road. The rock climber is safe and in control, but if Ed drives by, the thick cord dragging along the side of his car will dislodge the rock climber, causing him to fall to his death. If Ed slows to a stop and waits, the rock climber will be able to reach a stable landing where the cord will not dislodge him, but it will be too late to save the five people. If Ed continues to drive, the one person will fall to his death and the five will be saved.

Continuing to drive is the only option that will save the five people, so it is permissible.

Question:Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital.  They are in 
 critical condition and will die if Jack makes any stops along the way.  In his hurry to pack them in the car Jack slams the door on a few feet of thick cord that is now dangling beside the car.  Jack takes the fastest route to the hospital, which is a narrow, unpaved mountain pass.  On his way, Jack sees a rock climber hanging onto the side of the mountain beside the road.  The rock climber is losing control and is about to fall to his death, but he could be saved if he had a cord to pull himself up.

 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

7
Why?

The reason is that Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital who are in critical condition and will die if he makes any stops. The one person who is hanging onto the side of the mountain is already in a precarious position and is likely to die anyway, so it is better to save the five people who have a chance of being saved.

Question:Rushing into a burning house, Fred hears the voices of five people trapped 
 in a room. In order to reach them, Fred must remove a pile of rubble blocking the room’s entrance.  If he does not remove it immediately, all five will die.  Fred could smash the rubble out of the way using a sledgehammer and free the five trapped people.  Lodged in the rubble is one person who is slowly escaping, and will survive without Fred’s help.  Using the sledgehammer will unavoidably hit and kill the one person before he escapes.  If Fred uses the sledgehammer, the one person will die, but the five will be saved.  If Fred does not use the sledgehammer, the one person will escape on his own and the five people will die. Using the sledgehammer is…

The reason is that there is a greater good at stake. Although one person will die if Fred uses the sledgehammer, five people will be saved. This makes the action of using the sledgehammer permissible, since the good outcome outweighs the bad.

 Answer:

7
Why?

The question asks what is obligatory, and the answer is that it is obligatory to use the sledgehammer in order to save the five people who are trapped. It is not permissible to let the one person die in order to save the five, because that would be sacrificing one person for the good of others, which is not permissible.

 Answer:

Why?

The seven point scale is intended to measure the moral obligation one has in a given situation. In this case, the situation is one where five people will die unless Fred takes action. Given that using the sledgehammer is the only way to save the five people, it is clear that Fred has a moral obligation to use the sledgehammer, even though it will result in the death of one person.

Why?

Fred is faced with a difficult choice: save the five people trapped in the room, or allow the one person lodged in the rubble to escape. While using the sledgehammer will unavoidably kill the one person, it is the only way to save the five people. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, it is permissible for Fred to use the sledgehammer.

However, Joe sees another swimmer drowning in the distance.  Joe can save the one swimmer by immediately moving toward him in the motorboat, thereby leaving the channel open to the shark.

Question:Casey is drifting along in his motorboat near the mouth of a narrow 
 channel when he notices a shark approaching.  Further down the channel he sees five swimmers.  However, one other swimmer is positioned at the mouth of the channel such that the shark will attack the one first, giving the five the necessary time to escape.  Casey can save the one swimmer by immediately moving toward him in the motorboat, but saving the one swimmer would also leave the channel open to the shark.  If Casey moves towards the one swimmer, the one swimmer will live but the five swimmers will be eaten by the shark.  If Casey does not move toward him, the one swimmer will drown but the five swimmers will remain safe.  Not moving toward the one swimmer is…
