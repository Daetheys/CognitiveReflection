Yes, it is appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the five workmen.
Why?

There are a few different ethical theories that could be used to justify this decision, but the most relevant one here is probably utilitarianism. This theory holds that the right thing to do is always the thing that will produce the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. In this case, hitting the switch will produce more happiness (by saving the lives of the five workmen) than it will cost in happiness (by causing the death of the single workman). Therefore, it is the right thing to do from a utilitarian perspective.

In this case, hitting the switch would save the lives of five people, while sacrificing the life of only one person. This would result in a net increase in happiness, and so it would be the right thing to do according to utilitarianism.

Why?

The trolley will cause the deaths of five workmen if it is not diverted, while only one workman will die if it is diverted. Therefore, it is more morally permissible to divert the trolley, even though this will cause the death of one person.

Yes, it is appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the five workmen.
Why?

There are several reasons why this course of action may be seen as the most ethical. First, it could be argued that the death of one person is less serious than the death of five people. Second, the death of the five workers is likely to have a greater impact on their families and the community than the death of the one worker. Third, the five workers are innocent bystanders who are not responsible for the situation, whereas the one worker is responsible for his own death. Finally, hitting the switch is the only way to save the lives of the five workers, so it is the only ethically permissible course of action.

You are the late-night watchman in a hospital. Due to an accident in 
 the building next door, there are deadly fumes rising up through the hospitalâ€™s ventilation system. In a certain room of the hospital are three patients. In another room there is a single patient. If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths.The only way to avoid the deaths of these patients is to hit a cer-tain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room contain-ing the three patients. As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room containing the single patient, causing his death.Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?

Yes, it is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients.
Why?

The reason is that the greater good is served by saving the three patients, even though it results in the death of the one patient. This is an example of the utilitarian moral principle, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.

Why?

It is appropriate to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients because it is the lesser of two evils. If the switch is not hit, then all four patients will die. Hitting the switch will cause the death of the one patient, but will save the lives of the three patients. Therefore, it is the lesser of two evils and is the appropriate thing to do.

Yes, it is appropriate for the watchman to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients.
Why?

The three patients in the room are innocent and have not done anything to deserve death. The watchman, by hitting the switch, is taking active steps to save their lives. The single patient in the other room is not innocent - he is responsible for the accident that caused the deadly fumes. He knew the risks involved in what he was doing and chose to do it anyway. As a result, his death is not the watchman's responsibility.

Yes, it is appropriate to destroy the sculpture in order to save the workmanâ€™s life.

Yes, it is appropriate for you to vote for Policy A over Policy B. Although Policy A has a higher chance of causing deaths, the number of potential deaths is much lower than with Policy B. Therefore, it is more appropriate to vote for the policy with the lower number of potential deaths, even if it has a higher chance of causing any deaths.
Why?

The expected number of deaths from Policy A is 90% Ã— 0 + 10% Ã— 1000 = 100. The expected number of deaths from Policy B is 92% Ã— 0 + 8% Ã— 10,000 = 800. Therefore, even though Policy A has a higher chance of causing any deaths, the expected number of deaths from Policy B is much higher.

Yes, it is appropriate for the individual to vote for Policy A over Policy B because Policy A has a lower chance of causing deaths than Policy B. This is the utilitarian perspective, which states that the best course of action is the one that results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
Why?

The reason why it is appropriate to vote for Policy A is because it will result in a lower number of deaths overall. Although there is a higher chance of some deaths occurring with Policy A, the number of deaths that will occur is significantly lower than with Policy B. This means that more people will be saved overall if Policy A is implemented, which is the main goal of the utilitarian perspective.

Yes, it is appropriate to lie to the guard in order to borrow the speedboat and warn the tourists about the storm. The tourists' safety is more important than the tycoon's property rights.
Why?

The tourists' safety is more important than the tycoon's property rights because the tourists' lives are in danger. The tycoon can always replace his speedboat, but the tourists may not be so lucky. Lying to the guard is the best way to ensure that the tourists are warned in time and that they can take shelter from the storm.

In this case, the good effect is saving the three patients, and the bad effect is the death of the seven patients. The switch must be hit in order to save the three patients, and the death of the seven patients is not intended. Therefore, the double effect principle applies and it is permissible to hit the switch.

Yes, it is appropriate for you to vote for Policy A over Policy B.
Why?

There are several reasons why Policy A may be preferable to Policy B, despite the fact that Policy B has a slightly lower chance of causing any deaths. Firstly, the potential cost of lives lost under Policy B is much higher than under Policy A â€“ 10 deaths is a lot more than 0 deaths. Secondly, the chance of Policy B causing any deaths at all is still quite high, at 12%. This means that there is a significant risk that Policy B could lead to some loss of life, even if the chance of it causing a large number of deaths is relatively low.

In contrast, Policy A has a much lower chance of causing any deaths at all (10%), and even if it does cause deaths, the number is likely to be much lower than under Policy B (1000 vs 10). Therefore, despite the fact that Policy A has a slightly higher chance of causing some deaths, the overall risk to life is much lower under this policy. This makes it the preferable option.

You are a member of a government legislature. The legislature is deciding between 
 two different policies concerning environmental hazards.Policy A has a 90% chance of causing no deaths at all and has a 10% chance of causing 1000 deaths. Policy B has a 88% chance of causing no deaths and a 12% chance of causing 10 deaths. Is it appropriate for you to vote for Policy A over Policy B?

Yes, it is appropriate for you to vote for Policy A over Policy B.
Why? 

Since Policy A has a lower chance of causing any deaths, and the potential consequences of Policy B are more severe, it is more prudent to vote in favor of Policy A.

You open the wallet and find that it contains several hundred dollars in cash as well the ownerâ€™s driverâ€™s license.From the credit cards and other items in the wallet itâ€™s very clear that the walletâ€™s owner is wealthy. You, on the other hand, have been hit by hard times recently and could really use some extra money. You consider sending the wallet back to the owner without the cash, keeping the cash for yourself.Is it appropriate for you to keep the money you found in the wallet in order to have more money for yourself?

No, it would not be appropriate for you to keep the money you found in the wallet. While you may be in need of extra money, it is not yours to take. The rightful owner of the money is the person whose wallet it was found in. If you take the money, you would be stealing from them.
Why?

The money in the wallet does not belong to you, so taking it would be stealing. Even if the owner of the wallet is wealthy, that does not give you the right to take their money without their permission. If you need money, there are other ways to get it that don't involve taking someone else's property.
