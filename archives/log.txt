There are a number of reasons why the survivors of a plane crash would most likely be buried in the country where the crash occurred. First, if the survivors are from the same country as the crash, it would be easier for their families to visit their gravesites. Second, if the majority of the plane wreckage is located in one country, it would be easier to bury the survivors in that country. Finally, if the cause of the crash is unknown, it may be easier to investigate if the survivors are buried in the country where the crash occurred.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke from the locomotive blows west.

Why ?

Because the wind blows west and the smoke from the locomotive is carried west by the wind.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke from the locomotive blows west.

Why ?

The wind blows west. The wind blows the smoke west.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke from the locomotive blows in the direction that is opposite to the direction in which the wind blows. Therefore, the smoke from the locomotive blows east.

Why ?

The smoke from the locomotive is blown in the direction that is opposite to the direction in which the wind blows because the smoke is lighter than the air around it. The wind blows the smoke in the direction that is opposite to the direction in which the wind blows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke from the locomotive blows to the east.

Why ?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke from the locomotive blows northwest.

Why ?

The answer is that the Coriolis effect deflects the smoke to the right in the Northern Hemisphere.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke blows north.

Why ?

The smoke from a locomotive is carried away from the engine by the wind. The wind in this case is blowing from the west. Therefore, the smoke must be blowing north.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow ?

The smoke from the locomotive blows north.

Why ?

Why ?

It would be considered ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow because it would provide stability and support for the sister. Additionally, it would allow the sister to stay close to her deceased sister's husband and maintain a relationship with him.

Why ?

If the sister was not of legal age, then she would not be able to give legal consent to the marriage. This would mean that the man would be marrying someone who could not legally agree to the marriage, which would not be ethical.

If the sister did not consent to the marriage, then the man would be forcing her into a marriage against her will. This would also not be ethical.

The main reason why it may not be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow is due to the fact that it could be seen as exploiting the death of his widow. If the man and his widow were close, it is likely that her sister would be grieving her death and would not want to see her sister's widower marry someone else so soon after her death. Additionally, if the man's widow passed away under tragic circumstances, her sister may feel that she is exploiting her death by marrying him.

Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow ?

There is no definitive answer to this question since it depends on the specific circumstances involved. Some people might argue that it is ethical if the sister is willing and the two have a strong relationship, while others might say that it is not ethical because it could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. Ultimately, it is up to the individuals involved to decide what is best for them.

Why ?

The main reason why this question is difficult to answer definitively is because there are a lot of potential variables involved. For example, if the sister is grieving the loss of her sister, the man may be taking advantage of her vulnerability.

Ultimately, it is up to the individuals involved to decide what is best for them.

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific circumstances involved. Some people may argue that it is morally acceptable under certain circumstances, such as if the sister is willing and able to provide care and support for the widower and his children.

For these reasons, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such a marriage before making any decisions.

Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow ?

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a number of factors, including the relationship between the man and his widow's sister, the circumstances of his widow's death, and the views of the sister herself. If the man and his widow's sister are close and have a good relationship, then it is probably ethical for the man to marry her. However, if the widow's sister is not interested in marrying the man, or if the circumstances of the widow's death are such that it would be difficult for the man to marry her, then it may not be ethical for the man to marry her.

Why ?

The reason why it might not be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow is because it could be seen as taking advantage of the fact that the woman is grieving and vulnerable. If the widow's sister is not interested in marrying the man, then it would be unfair to her to force her into a relationship that she does not want.

Why ?

There are a number of potential reasons why someone might view it as unethical to marry the sister of their deceased spouse. One reason could be that it could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, as the sister may be vulnerable following the death of her sibling. Additionally, it could be considered disrespectful to the memory of the deceased spouse if their partner were to marry someone so closely related to them. Some people may also feel that it would be unfair to the sister if she were to marry someone who had recently lost a sibling, as she would effectively be taking on the role of replacement.

The reason why this question is difficult to answer definitively is because there are a few different ethical considerations that could come into play. For example, some people might argue that it is only ethical to marry the sister of one's late wife if the late wife had specifically given her consent to such an arrangement. On the other hand, others might argue that it is not ethical to marry the sister of one's late wife because it could be seen as taking advantage of the fact that the late wife is no longer alive and therefore unable to give her consent.

Ultimately, it is up to the widower and the sister to decide if they think it would be an ethical marriage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow ?

The ethics of marrying the sister of one's widow depend on the circumstances of the situation. If the widow is deceased and there is no familial relationship between the man and the sister, then it would be ethical. However, if the widow is alive and the man is still married to her, then it would be unethical.

Why ?

Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow ?

There is no easy answer for this question. It depends on the circumstances and on the relationship between the man and his late wife's sister.

Ultimately, the decision would come down to the individuals involved and what they believe is best for them.

Why ?

Why ?

The main reason why this might be considered unethical is because it could be seen as taking advantage of the sister. If the sister is underage, then the man would be marrying her without her full consent. If the sister does not consent to the marriage, then the man would be forcing her into a relationship against her will. In either case, it could be argued that the man is taking advantage of the sister and that this is unethical.
