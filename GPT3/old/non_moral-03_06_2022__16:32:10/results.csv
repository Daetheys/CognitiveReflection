The simple answer is that I trust my pharmacist. He is a professional who has my best interests at heart, and if he says that the generic product is just as good as the name-brand product, then I believe him.

There are other considerations as well.

Additionally, if the pharmacy is out of the name-brand product, it's likely that other pharmacies in the area are also out, so it may be difficult to find what I'm looking for.

The answer is because expected value. The expected value of a lottery is the sum of the probabilities of all the possible outcomes, multiplied by their corresponding payouts.

There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as it depends on the individual's preferences.
