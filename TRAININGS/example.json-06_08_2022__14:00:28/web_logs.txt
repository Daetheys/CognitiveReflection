The reason is simple: more turnips means more income, and thus more money to reinvest in the farm or spend on other things. Therefore, it is always in the best interest of the farm worker to choose the path that will result in the greatest yield.</p><b style="color: white">QUESTION 1 | iteration = 5:</b><p style="color: white"> You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine.

The reason is simple: more turnips means more money. With ten bushels of turnips, I might be able to sell them for $100. But with twenty bushels of turnips, I could sell them for $200.
