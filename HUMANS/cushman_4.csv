If Don stops to save the one swimmer on the side of the channel, he will not be able to get to the five swimmers in time to save them. If Don continues to speed towards the five swimmers past the one swimmer, the one swimmer will drown, but he will reach the five swimmers in time to save them.

The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio on board to receive a warning. Mark takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock. The only way Mark can stop the captain from transmitting the disease is to use a missile to blow up the ship. If Mark fires the missile, the captain will die and the five islanders will live. If Mark does not fire the missile, the captain will live and the five islanders will die. Is firing the missile the right thing to do?","I think so","74090","2022-09-21 16:25:31"

If John does not drive toward them at top speed, he will not arrive in time, and all five will die. In order to drive at top speed, John must lighten the load on his boat. The only way to lighten the load is to push his passenger with his hands and cause the passenger to tumble off the back of the boat. This passenger cannot swim and will drown. If John pushes the passenger, the one passenger will drown, but Dave will save the five drowning swimmers. If Dave does not push the passenger, the one passenger will not drown, but the five swimmers will drown.

Rick knows that if he breaks open the window he will hit the man with his fist, the man will fall off and die, but the five children will be safely evacuated.

In his hurry to pack them in the car Ed slams the door on a few feet of thick cord that is now dangling beside the car. Ed takes the fastest route to the hospital, which is a narrow, unpaved mountain pass. On his way, Ed sees a rock climber hanging onto the side of the mountain beside the road. The rock climber is safe and in control, but if Ed drives by the thick cord dragging along the side of his car will dislodge the rock climber, causing him to fall to his death. If Ed slows to a stop and waits, the rock climber will be able to reach a stable landing where the cord will not dislodge him, but it will be too late to save the five people.
