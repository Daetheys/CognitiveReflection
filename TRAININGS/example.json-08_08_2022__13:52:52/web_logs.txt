Yes, I would turn my turnip-picking machine to the right to harvest twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten.</p><p style="color: #5294E2"> Why?</p><p style="color: #69BC95"> 

The reason is simple: more turnips means more money. By choosing the path on the right, I can double my earnings. And since I'm already driving a turnip-harvesting machine, it's not like I have to put in any extra effort. So it's a no-brainer!</p>
