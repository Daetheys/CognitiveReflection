Question: Evan sees that an empty runaway boxcar is about to hit five 
 people working on the track ahead. They are too far away to be warned.  The only way to stop the boxcar is for it to hit something heavy. Next to Evan is a switch that can be flipped to turn the boxcar away from the five people onto a side track that loops and then rejoins the main track. One person, unaware of the boxcar, is working on this looped side track. This person, if hit, will cause the boxcar to stop before it reaches the five people on the main track.  If Evan flips the switch, the boxcar will turn onto the side track, hit the one person and therefore stop before it reaches to the five people.

This is a difficult question. On the one hand, Dave is causing the death of one person in order to save the lives of five others. On the other hand, if Dave does not accelerate quickly, the five swimmers will definitely drown. From a utilitarian perspective, it may be better to sacrifice one life to save five.

Because while it is still technically possible for the five swimmers to drown if Dave does not accelerate quickly, it is not certain that they will drown.

Question: Tim works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine 
 that can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death. Tim notices that the machine has pumped a near toxic amount of the chemical into a patient's body. Tim must immediately stop the machine to save the patient's life. However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients. If Tim stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Tim doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive.

Question:Andy is a fireman trying to help five children out of a burning 
 house.  There is only one window from which the children can be safely evacuated, and it is jammed shut.

The seven point scale is often used in discussions of ethics and morality, with ""obligatory"" corresponding to the idea that one ought to do something, ""permissible"" corresponding to the idea that one may do something, and ""forbidden"" corresponding to the idea that one ought not to do something. In this particular case, the question is whether or not it is morally permissible for Peter to push the man into the window in order to save the five children. Given that all other options involve at least one death, it seems that the only morally permissible option is for Peter to push the man into the window, even though doing so will result in the man's death."

Question:George receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio to receive a warning.  George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.  George could fire a missile into the water next to the ship, causing a splash that would put out the fire and save the captain.

Question:George receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship.

The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio to receive a warning.  George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.

Question:Ed is driving five sick people to the hospital.  They are in 
 critical condition and will die if Ed makes any stops along the way.  In his hurry to pack them in the car Ed slams the door on a few feet of thick cord that is now dangling beside the car.  Ed takes the fastest route to the hospital, which is a narrow, unpaved mountain pass.  On his way, Ed sees a rock climber hanging onto the side of the mountain beside the road.  The rock climber is safe and in control, but if Ed drives by the thick cord dragging along the side of his car will dislodge the rock climber, causing him to fall to his death.  If Ed slows to a stop and waits, the rock climber will be able to reach a stable landing where the cord will not dislodge him, but it will be too late to save the five people.

Question:Rushing into a burning house, Ethan hears the voices of five people trapped
