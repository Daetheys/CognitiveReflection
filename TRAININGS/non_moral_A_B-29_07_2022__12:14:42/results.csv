The FDA requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the brand-name drug. Although generic drugs must have the same active ingredient, they do not have to have the same inactive ingredients. Inactive ingredients are added to a drug to bind it together, stabilize it, help it dissolve, or color it. Many people are allergic to one or more inactive ingredients, which is why it is important to know what is in each drug you take."
