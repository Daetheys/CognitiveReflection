Question: Evan sees that an empty runaway boxcar is about to hit five 
 people working on the track ahead. They are too far away to be warned.  The only way to stop the boxcar is for it to hit something heavy. Next to Evan is a switch that can be flipped to turn the boxcar away from the five people onto a side track that loops and then rejoins the main track. One person, unaware of the boxcar, is working on this looped side track. This person, if hit, will cause the boxcar to stop before it reaches the five people on the main track.  If Evan flips the switch, the boxcar will turn onto the side track, hit the one person and therefore stop before it reaches to the five people. If Evan does not flip the switch, the boxcar will continue on the main track and hit the five people and not the one person. Flipping the switch is…

If Evan flips the switch, the boxcar will turn onto the side track, hit the one person and therefore stop before it reaches to the five people. If Evan does not flip the switch, the boxcar will continue on the main track and hit the five people and not the one person. Flipping the switch is…

 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

4
Why?

Evan is faced with a difficult choice: save five people by sacrificing one, or do nothing and let five people die. While there is no easy answer, flipping the switch is the most ethical choice. By sacrificing one person, Evan is able to save five. Although the death of the one person working on the side track is tragic, it is less tragic than the death of five people.

 Answer:

Why?

Robert can provide the antidote to the one villager without anyone knowing, so there is no risk of being caught and punished. Additionally, while Robert would be saving one life by giving the antidote, five other lives would be lost if he did not give it. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, it is better for Robert to give the antidote to the one villager.

Why?

The question asks whether it is permissible for Robert to withhold the antidote from the one villager. On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being "forbidden" and 7 being "obligatory", 4 is classified as "permissible". This means that while Robert is not required to provide the antidote, he is also not forbidden from doing so.

 Answer:

Why?

Dave is faced with a choice between two courses of action, each of which will result in the death of one person. He can either accelerate quickly and cause a passenger to tumble off the back of the boat, resulting in the death of that passenger, or he can choose not to accelerate quickly and allow the five swimmers to drown. In this case, the morally permissible course of action is to choose the option that will result in the death of only one person.

Question: Tim works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine 
 that can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death. Tim notices that the machine has pumped a near toxic amount of the chemical into a patient's body. Tim must immediately stop the machine to save the patient's life. However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients. If Tim stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Tim doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive. Not stopping the machine is…

Question:Bob works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine that 
 can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death. Bob notices that the machine has pumped a near toxic amount of the chemical into a patient's body. Bob must immediately stop the machine to save the patient's life. However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients and will continue to do so only if it can maintain equilibrium by continuing to pump the chemical into the one patient. If Bob stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Bob doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive.

Andy must immediately use an object to smash open this large, heavy window or else all five children will die.

The man will break open the window, fall out and die, but the five children will be safely evacuated.

Question:Andy is a fireman trying to help five children out of a burning 
 house.  There is only one window from which the children can be safely evacuated, and it is jammed shut.  Andy must immediately use an object to smash open this large, heavy window or else all five children will die.

The man will break open the window, fall out and die, but the five children will be safely evacuated. If Andy does not swing the burning debris, causing the man to break open the window, the man will safely escape, but the five children will die. Swinging the burning debris is…

Rick is faced with a dilemma: if he breaks open the window, he will save the five children but cause the death of the man on the sill. If he does not break open the window, the man will be saved but the children will die. In this case, the morally correct thing to do is to break open the window, since saving the lives of five children is more important than saving the life of one man.

Question:Rick is a fireman trying to help five children out of a burning 
 house.  There is only one window from which the children can be safely evacuated, and it is jammed shut.  Rick must immediately smash open this large, heavy window  or else all five children will die.  Outside the window, on the sill, is a man safely awaiting evacuation who Rick cannot help hitting with his fist if he breaks the window.  Rick knows that if he breaks open the window he will hit the man with his fist, the man will fall off and die, but the five children will be safely evacuated.

 Answer:

4
Why?

Rick is faced with a difficult decision. If he breaks open the window, he will save the five children but cause the death of the man on the sill. If he does not break open the window, the man will be saved but the children will die. Either way, someone will die.

Breaking open the window is the lesser of two evils and is therefore permissible.

Mark takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The only way Mark can stop the captain from transmitting the disease is to use a missile to blow up the ship.  If Mark fires the missile, the captain will die and the five islanders will live.  If Mark does not fire the missile, the captain will live and the five islanders will die. Firing the missile is…

Question:George receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio to receive a warning.  George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.  George could fire a missile into the water next to the ship, causing a splash that would put out the fire and save the captain. If George fires the missile the captain will live but the disease will be transmitted, killing the five islanders.  If George does not fire the missile the captain will die and the five islanders will live. Not firing the missile is…

 Answer:

The reasoning behind this is that, although the captain will die if George does not fire the missile, the captain is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms. Therefore, George is not directly responsible for the captain's death. However, if George does fire the missile, he will be directly responsible for the death of the five islanders.

 Answer:

Why?

The question asks what Alan should do in this situation - should he pull the lever and release the repairman's leg, or should he not pull the lever and allow the boxcar to hit the repairman but not the other five workers.

There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as it depends on Alan's personal values and beliefs. If Alan believes that it is more important to save the life of the one repairman, then he should pull the lever. If Alan believes that it is more important to save the lives of the five workers, then he should not pull the lever.

 Answer from a scale  of 1 to 7 where 1 is labeled "Forbidden", 4 is labeled "Permissible", and 7 is labeled "Obligatory".
            
 Answer:

4
Why?

Since the boxcar is empty and out of control, it poses a danger to the repairmen on the track. By pulling the lever, Luke can redirect the boxcar to an empty sidetrack, thus saving the repairmen from being hit and killed. However, this action will cause the switch to crush another repairman standing by. Although this repairman will die as a result of Luke's action, it is still permissible since Luke is acting to save the lives of the other repairmen.
