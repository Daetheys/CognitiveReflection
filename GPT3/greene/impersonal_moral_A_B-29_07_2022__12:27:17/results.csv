The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The basic premise is that there is a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you see that there is one person tied up on the side track. The trolley would kill that person if you pulled the lever. So here’s the question: Is it morally permissible for you to pull the lever, thereby switching the trolley onto the side track and killing the one person, in order to save the five people on the main track?

Most people say that it is permissible to pull the lever in this case. After all, you would be sacrificing one life to save five. But what if the situation were different? What if, instead of being able to pull a lever to switch the trolley, you were standing on a footbridge over the tracks, and the only way to save the five people on the main track was to push a very large person standing next to you"

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics first introduced by British philosopher Philippa Foot. The general form of the problem is as follows: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person tied up on the side track. You have two options:

Do nothing, and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

The problem is designed to test our intuitive sense of morality. What is the right thing to do?"

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics and philosophy, typically used to illustrate the problem of utilitarianism. The problem is as follows: there is a runaway trolley heading towards five workers who will be killed if the trolley continues on its current path. The only way to save the workers is to push a large switch that will redirect the trolley onto a different set of tracks. However, there is a person on the other set of tracks who will be killed if the trolley is redirected.

So the question is, should you push the switch and kill the one person to save the five workers? Or do nothing and allow the five workers to be killed?

Most people would say that it is better to push the switch and kill the one person, in order to save the five workers. This is the utilitarian solution to the problem."

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics and psychology, typically used to illustrate the differences between utilitarianism and deontology. The problem is as follows: There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.
Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Which is the more ethical choice?

Utilitarians would argue that the more ethical choice is to pull the lever, because this would result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In other words, one death is better than five deaths. Deontologists, on the other hand, would argue that the more ethical choice is to do nothing, because it is wrong to kill people, even if it results in a"
