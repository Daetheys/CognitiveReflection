You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two 
 diverging paths. By choosing the path on the left you will harvest ten bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest twenty bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-harvesting machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-picking machine to the right in order to harvest twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten?

Yes, I would turn my turnip-picking machine to the right in order to harvest twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten.
Why?

The reason is simple: more turnips. By choosing the path on the right, I will be able to harvest twice as many turnips as if I had chosen the path on the left. This extra amount of turnips would be beneficial, especially if I were running a turnip farm.

You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of 
 buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

Yes, I would purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product.

The simple answer is that I trust my pharmacist. He is a professional who has my best interests at heart, and if he says that the generic product is just as good as the name-brand product, then I believe him.

There are other considerations as well. Name-brand products can be significantly more expensive than generic products, so if the generic product is just as good, then it makes sense to save money and go with the generic. Additionally, if the pharmacy is out of the name-brand product, it's likely that other pharmacies in the area are also out, so it may be difficult to find what I'm looking for. In that case, again, it makes more sense to just go with the generic product.

When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

Yes, I would purchase the generic brand.
Why?

The pharmacist is a trusted source of information, and if he says that the generic brand is the same as the name-brand product, then I believe him. I would rather purchase the generic brand and save money than search for the name-brand product and spend more money.

Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

Yes, I would purchase the generic brand.
Why?

There are a few reasons why I would purchase the generic brand. First, I know and trust the pharmacist, so if he says the generic product is exactly the same, then I believe him. Second, even if the generic product is not exactly the same, it is likely to be close enough that it will still be effective in treating my headache. And finally, the generic product is likely to be much cheaper than the name-brand product, so it makes financial sense to purchase the generic.

You are looking to buy a new computer. At the moment the computer 
 that you want costs $1000. A friend who knows the computer industry has told you that this computer’s price will drop to $500 next month.If you wait until next month to buy your new computer you will have to use your old computer for a few weeks longer than you would like to. Nevertheless you will be able to do everything you need to do using your old computer during that time.Would you use your old computer for a few more weeks in order to save $500 on the purchase of a new computer?

Yes, I would use my old computer for a few more weeks in order to save $500 on the purchase of a new computer.
Why?

The simple answer is that $500 is a lot of money, and saving it would be worth the inconvenience of using an older computer for a few more weeks. Additionally, if the new computer is not absolutely necessary, then it may make more sense to wait and save up the money rather than taking on additional debt or using credit to finance the purchase.

The answer to this question depends on the needs of the individual. Some people may need a new computer right away and cannot wait, while others may be able to get by with their old computer for a little while longer.
Why?

Some people may need a new computer right away because their old one is not functioning properly. In this case, it would not make sense to wait because the individual would need to use their old computer for a few weeks longer than they would like to. On the other hand, if someone's old computer is still functioning well, they may be able to get by with it for a little while longer and wait to buy a new one.

 home while you are having a quiet dinner by yourself.The representative explains that if you are willing to spend a half an hour answering questions about a variety of topics her organization will send you a check for $200.Would you interrupt your dinner in order to earn $200?

Yes, I would interrupt my dinner to earn $200.
Why?

The amount of money being offered is significant, and I would be able to use that money for a variety of purposes. Additionally, half an hour is not a significant amount of time, and I would be able to answer the questions during that time frame.

You have gone to a bookstore to buy $50 worth of books. You 
 have with you two coupons.One of these coupons gives you 30% off of your purchase price. This coupon expires tomorrow. The other coupon gives you 25% off your purchase price, and this coupon does not expire for another year. Would you use the 30%-off coupon for your present purchase so that you will have another coupon to use during the coming year?

No, I would not use the 30%-off coupon for my present purchase so that I will have another coupon to use during the coming year.
Why?

The 30%-off coupon gives me a bigger discount on my purchase, so I would use that one. I would save $15 with the 30%-off coupon, whereas I would only save $12.50 with the 25%-off coupon.

Therefore, it makes more sense to use the 25%-off coupon today and save the 30%-off coupon for another purchase in the future.

An old friend has invited you to spend the weekend with him at 
 his summer home some ways up the coast from where you are. You intend to travel there by car, and there are two routes that you can take: the highway and the coastal road.The highway will get you to your friend’s house in about three hours, but the scenery along the highway is very boring. The coastal route will get you to your friend’s house in about three hours and fifteen minutes, and the scenery along the coastal road is breathtakingly beautiful.Would you take the coastal route in order to observe the beautiful scenery as you drive?

Yes, I would take the coastal route in order to observe the beautiful scenery.
Why?

The reason I would take the coastal route is because I value the experience of seeing beautiful scenery more than I value saving 15 minutes on my drive. Even though the highway is faster, the coastal road is more enjoyable and memorable, so it is worth taking the slightly longer route.

You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two 
 diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?

Yes.
Why?

The path on the right will lead to a smaller yield of turnips, but it will also require less time and effort to harvest them. This is the more efficient option, and it will allow the farm worker to complete their task more quickly.

 working at the shop tells you that it will cost you about $100 to have it fixed.You noticed in the paper that morning that the electronics shop next door is having a sale on VCR’s and that a certain new VCR which is slightly better than your old one is on sale for $100.Would you have your old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one?

No, I would not have my old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one.
Why?

There are a few reasons why I would not have my old VCR fixed in this scenario. Firstly, $100 is a lot of money to spend on repairing an old VCR when you can buy a new one for the same price. Secondly, the new VCR is likely to be a better quality than the old one, so it makes more sense to invest in the new one. Finally, even if the old VCR is repaired, it is likely to break again in the future and you will have to spend more money to repair it, so it is better to just buy a new one.

I would have my old VCR fixed.
Why?

There are several reasons why I would have my old VCR fixed rather than buying a new one. First of all, I am familiar with my old VCR and know how to use it. Buying a new VCR would mean that I would have to spend time reading the manual and learning how to use the new features. Secondly, even though the new VCR may be slightly better than my old one, it is not worth spending an extra $100 just for a few new features that I may not even use. Finally, repairing my old VCR is likely to be cheaper than buying a new one, especially if the repair shop offers a warranty on their work.

Why?

Second, even though the new VCR may be slightly better than my old one, it may not be worth spending the money to upgrade when my old VCR still works fine. Finally, I may be attached to my old VCR for sentimental reasons and would rather not get rid of it.

It depends on the extent of the damage to the VCR. If it is a simple fix, then it may be worth it to have it repaired. However, if the damage is extensive, then it may be better to invest in a new VCR.
Why? 

The reason is that if the damage to the VCR is extensive, then it is likely that it will require more repairs in the future. These repairs can end up costing more than a new VCR, so it is better to invest in a new one from the start.

Why?

The answer is because expected value. The expected value of a lottery is the sum of the probabilities of all the possible outcomes, multiplied by their corresponding payouts. In this case, the expected value of the Car A raffle is higher than the expected value of the Car B raffle. This is because the probability of winning the Car A raffle is higher, and the payout (the car) is the same.

Thus, buying a ticket for the Car B raffle would be a poor decision, from a purely expected value perspective.

You are preparing pasta with fresh vegetables, and you are deciding on the 
 order in which you will do the various things you need to do. You are in a big hurry.At the moment you have a slight urge to cut vegetables. If you first start the water boiling and then cut the vegetables you will be done in twenty minutes. If you cut the vegetables and then start the water boiling you will be done in forty minutes.Would you cut the vegetables first and then start the water boiling in order to satisfy your slight urge to cut vegetables?

Yes, I would cut the vegetables first and then start the water boiling.
Why?

In this case, it would be faster to cut the vegetables first and then start the water boiling. By the time the water is boiling, the vegetables would be ready to be cooked.

No, I would not cut the vegetables first and then start the water boiling in order to satisfy my slight urge to cut vegetables.
Why?

There are a few reasons why this wouldn't make sense. First, if you are in a big hurry, boiling the water first will get you done in half the time. Second, cutting the vegetables first may make them more difficult to cook evenly, as they will have more surface area exposed to the heat. Third, if you are using fresh vegetables, they are likely to be more fragile and delicate before they are cut, so cutting them first may make them more difficult to work with.

Yes, I would cut the vegetables first and then start the water boiling in order to satisfy my slight urge to cut vegetables.
Why?

There are a few reasons why this would be the best option. First, it would allow me to get the cutting out of the way so that I can focus on boiling the water and cooking the pasta. Second, it would help me to save time overall since I would be able to get the vegetables prepped and ready to go before starting the water. Finally, it would allow me to satisfy my slight urge to cut vegetables without having to stop what I'm doing to do it.

Ultimately, the decision comes down to what the individual values more.
Why?

The two firms and the two positions are otherwise very similar, so the individual's decision will come down to what they value more: a higher salary or more vacation days. If the individual values a higher salary more, then they will probably choose to accept Firm A's offer. If the individual values more vacation days more, then they will probably choose to accept Firm B's offer.
