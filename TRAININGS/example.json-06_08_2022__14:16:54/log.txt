You are bringing home a number of plants from a store that is about two miles from your home. The trunk of your car, which you’ve lined with plastic to catch the mud from the plants, will hold most of the plants you’ve purchased.You could bring all the plants home in one trip, but this would require putting some of the plants in the back seat as well as in the trunk. By putting some of the plants in the back seat you will ruin your fine leather upholstery which would cost thousands of dollars to replace.Would you make two trips home in order to avoid ruining the upholstery of your car?

Yes, I would make two trips home to avoid ruining the upholstery of my car.
Why?

The cost of replacing the upholstery on my car would be much greater than the cost of making an extra trip to the store. Therefore, it makes financial sense to make two trips in order to preserve the upholstery on my car.
