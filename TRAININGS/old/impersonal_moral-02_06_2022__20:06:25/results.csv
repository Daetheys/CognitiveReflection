There are several possible ethical theories that could be used to justify this action, but the most straightforward one is utilitarianism. This theory holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. In this case, hitting the switch would produce more happiness (by preventing the deaths of five people) than not hitting the switch (which would result in the deaths of five people). Therefore, according to utilitarianism, hitting the switch is the morally right thing to do."

The watchman has a duty to protect the patients in the hospital. By hitting the switch, the watchman is taking the best course of action to protect the patients.
