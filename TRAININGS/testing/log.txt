You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest ten bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest twenty bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-harvesting machine will turn to the leftWould you turn your turnip-picking machine to the right in order to harvest twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten?

Yes.

Why ?

Because harvesting more turnips is better than harvesting fewer turnips.------------------------------------
You are bringing home a number of plants from a store that is about two miles from your home. The trunk of your car, which you’ve lined with plastic to catch the mud from the plants, will hold most of the plants you’ve purchased.You could bring all the plants home in one trip, but this would require putting some of the plants in the back seat as well as in the trunk. By putting some of the plants in the back seat you will ruin your fine leather upholstery which would cost thousands of dollars to replace.Would you make two trips home in order to avoid ruining the upholstery of your car?

Yes

Why ?

I would make two trips home in order to avoid ruining the upholstery of my car. This is because the cost of replacing the upholstery would be much greater than the cost of making two trips.------------------------------------
You are in charge of scheduling appointments in a dentist’s office. Two people, Mr. Morris and Mrs. Santiago have called to make appointments for next Monday. The only available times for next Monday are at 10:00 AM and at 3:00 PM.Mr. Morris’s schedule is rather flexible. He can have his appointment either at 10:00 AM or at 3:00 PM. Mrs. Santiago’s schedule is less flexible. She can only have her appointment at 10:00 AM.Would you schedule Mr. Morris for 3:00 PM so that both he and Mrs. Santiago can have their appointments next Monday?

Yes, I would schedule Mr. Morris for 3:00 PM so that both he and Mrs. Santiago can have their appointments next Monday.

Why ?

Scheduling Mr. Morris for 3:00 PM would be the best option for both patients. It would allow Mrs. Santiago to have her appointment at 10:00 AM, and it would give Mr. Morris the flexibility to choose his appointment time.------------------------------------
You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

Yes, I would purchase the generic brand over the name brand.

Why ?

I would purchase the generic brand because I trust the pharmacist's opinion. If the pharmacist says that the generic brand is "exactly the same" as the name brand, then I believe him. I would rather purchase the generic brand and save some money than spend more money on the name brand.------------------------------------

Yes, I would substitute macadamia nuts for walnuts in order to avoid eating walnuts.

Why ?

I don't like the taste of walnuts, but I do like the taste of macadamia nuts.------------------------------------

A friend who knows the computer industry has told you that this computer’s price will drop to $500 next month.If you wait until next month to buy your new computer you will have to use your old computer for a few weeks longer than you would like to. Nevertheless you will be able to do everything you need to do using your old computer during that time.Would you use your old computer for a few more weeks in order to save $500 on the purchase of a new computer?

Yes, I would wait to save on the purchase.

Why ?

I would use the 30% off coupon for my present purchase.

Why ?

I would use the 30% off coupon because it is a better deal than the 25% off coupon. I would rather have 30% off my purchase price today than 25% off my purchase price a year from now.------------------------------------
An old friend has invited you to spend the weekend with him at his summer home some ways up the coast from where you are. You intend to travel there by car, and there are two routes that you can take: the highway and the coastal road.The highway will get you to your friend’s house in about three hours, but the scenery along the highway is very boring. The coastal route will get you to your friend’s house in about three hours and fifteen minutes, and the scenery along the coastal road is breathtakingly beautiful.Would you take the coastal route in order to observe the beautiful scenery as you drive?

Yes

Why ?

I would take the coastal route in order to observe the beautiful scenery as I drive. I would much rather drive for an extra fifteen minutes and be able to take in the beautiful scenery than to drive on the highway for three hours with nothing to look at.------------------------------------

Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?

You are at home one day when the mail arrives. You receive a letter from a reputable corporation that provides financial services. They have invited you to invest in a mutual fund, beginning with an initial investment of one thousand dollars.As it happens, you are familiar with this particular mutual fund. It has not performed very well over the past few years, and, based on what you know, there is no reason to think that it will perform any better in the future.Would you invest a thousand dollars in this mutual fund in order to make money?

No, I would not.

Why ?

There is no reason to think that the fund will perform any better in the future, so investing in it would be a waste of money.------------------------------------
You have brought your broken VCR to the local repair shop. The woman working at the shop tells you that it will cost you about $100 to have it fixed.You noticed in the paper that morning that the electronics shop next door is having a sale on VCR’s and that a certain new VCR which is slightly better than your old one is on sale for $100.Would you have your old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one?

Yes, I would have my old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one.

Why ?

There are a few reasons why I would make this decision. First, I am generally not a fan of spending money on new things when my old things are still usable. I would rather put my money towards repairing what I already have rather than buying something new. Second, even though the new VCR is slightly better than my old one, it is not worth spending an extra $100 on when my old one can still be used. I would rather save that money or put it towards something else. Finally, I have sentimental value attached to my old VCR. It has been with me for many years and I have a lot------------------------------------

Why ?

I think that these two cars are equally good, and I have decided to buy one raffle ticket. If I buy a ticket for the Car B raffle, my chances of winning are lower than if I buy a ticket for the Car A raffle.------------------------------------
