There are several possible ethical theories that could be used to justify this action, but the most straightforward one is utilitarianism. This theory holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. In this case, hitting the switch would produce more happiness (by preventing the deaths of five people) than not hitting the switch (which would result in the deaths of five people). Therefore, according to utilitarianism, hitting the switch is the morally right thing to do."

 the building next door, there are deadly fumes rising up through the hospital’s ventilation system. In a certain room of the hospital are three patients. In another room there are seven patients. If you do nothing the fumes will rise up into the room containing the three patients and cause their deaths.The only way to save these patients is to hit a certain switch, which will cause the fumes to bypass the room containing the three people. As a result of doing this the fumes will enter the room con-taining the seven patients, causing their deaths.Is it appropriate for you to hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the three patients?

The three patients in the room are going to die if the switch is not hit, while the seven patients in the other room will only die if the switch is hit. Therefore, it is better to save the three patients and let the seven patients die."
