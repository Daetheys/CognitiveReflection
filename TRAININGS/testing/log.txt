You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest ten bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest twenty bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-harvesting machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-picking machine to the right in order to harvest twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten?

Yes, I would turn my machine to the right in order to harvested twenty bushels of turnips instead of ten.

 Why?

The reason is simple: more turnips means more money. By choosing the path on the right, I can increase my earnings by harvesting twice as many turnips.------------------------------------
You are bringing home a number of plants from a store that is about two miles from your home. The trunk of your car, which you’ve lined with plastic to catch the mud from the plants, will hold most of the plants you’ve purchased.You could bring all the plants home in one trip, but this would require putting some of the plants in the back seat as well as in the trunk. By putting some of the plants in the back seat you will ruin your fine leather upholstery which would cost thousands of dollars to replace.Would you make two trips home in order to avoid ruining the upholstery of your car?

Yes, I would make two trips home in order to avoid ruining the upholstery of my car.

 Why?

The cost of replacing the upholstery on my car would be much greater than the cost of making two trips home. Therefore, it makes financial sense to make two trips in order to avoid having to replace the upholstery.------------------------------------
You are in charge of scheduling appointments in a dentist’s office. Two people, Mr. Morris and Mrs. Santiago have called to make appointments for next Monday. The only available times for next Monday are at 10:00 AM and at 3:00 PM.Mr. Morris’s schedule is rather flexible. He can have his appointment either at 10:00 AM or at 3:00 PM. Mrs. Santiago’s schedule is less flexible. She can only have her appointment at 10:00 AM.Would you schedule Mr. Morris for 3:00 PM so that both he and Mrs. Santiago can have their appointments next Monday?

Yes, I would schedule Mr. Morris for 3:00 PM and Mrs. Santiago for 10:00 AM.

 Why?

Flexibility is important when scheduling appointments. Mr. Morris has indicated that he is willing to be flexible with his appointment time, so I would schedule him for the later time slot. This would allow Mrs. Santiago to have her appointment at the only time she is available.------------------------------------
You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

Yes, I would purchase the generic brand of headache medicine.

 Why?

There are a few reasons why I would purchase the generic brand of headache medicine instead of searching further for the name-brand product. First, I trust the pharmacist's judgement and he has assured me that the generic product is "exactly the same" as the name-brand product I was looking for. Second, even if the generic product is not exactly the same as the name-brand product, it is likely to be similar enough that it will still be effective in treating my headache. Finally, the generic product is usually cheaper than the name-brand product, so I would save money by purchasing the generic product.------------------------------------
