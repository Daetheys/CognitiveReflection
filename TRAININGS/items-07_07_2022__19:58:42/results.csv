It is not clear what the right thing to do is."
43,2,Why?,1,1,1,"

There are two possible outcomes of the situation - either the boxcar will hit the person on the side track, or it will not. If Ben flips the switch, he is deliberately causing the boxcar to hit the person, which some people might say is the wrong thing to do. On the other hand, if he does not flip the switch, the boxcar might still hit the person if it is not properly aligned with the track, which some people might say is also the wrong thing to do.

",0,2,0,"
According to the trolley problem, flipping the switch to send the boxcar onto the side track is the right thing to do."
45,2,Why?,1,2,1," 

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The scenario is as follows: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. The person is tied up and unable to move. You have two options: do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. Or, pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill the one person. What do you do?

The trolley problem is designed to test our intuitions about moral decisions. Most people say that it is better to divert the trolley onto the side track, even though this will kill the one person. The reason is that Diverting the trolley is the lesser of two evils. Although it will result in one death, it will save five lives."

",0,4,0,"
Yes, flipping the switch is the right thing to do."
49,2,Why?,1,4,1,"

The reason is that by flipping the switch, Ben is actively preventing someone from being harmed. If he does not flip the switch, then the person on the side track will be hit by the boxcar and could be seriously injured or killed. Therefore, it is better to flip the switch and send the boxcar onto the side track, even though it means that one person will be inconvenienced, than to do nothing and let someone be harmed."

It is not clear what the right thing to do is because it is not clear what the consequences of flipping the switch will be.

69,2,Why?,1,14,1,"

There is no right answer to this question because there is no one right answer. It depends on each person's individual values and beliefs. Some people might think that flipping the switch is the right thing to do because it would save the one person on the side track from being hit. Other people might think that flipping the switch is not the right thing to do because it would mean that the boxcar would be diverted from its intended track and hit the one person on the side track."

",0,15,0,"
No, flipping the switch would cause the boxcar to turn and hit the one person working on the side track."
71,2,Why?,1,15,1,"

",0,16,0,"
No, flipping the switch is not the right thing to do because it would result in somebody getting hit by the boxcar."
73,2,Why?,1,16,1,"

The principle of double effect says that it is sometimes permissible to allow a bad effect to occur if it is not the intention of the person taking the action, as long as there are not other bad effects that are reasonably foreseeable. In this case, the bad effect of the boxcar hitting somebody is reasonably foreseeable, so flipping the switch would not be permissible."

",0,17,0,"
No. Flipping the switch would result in the one person being hit by the boxcar."
75,2,Why?,1,17,1,"

It would be the right thing to do if there was someone in the boxcar who would be killed if the boxcar continued on the track. However, since there is nobody in the boxcar, there is no need to flip the switch."

77,2,Why?,1,18,1,"

If Ben flips the switch, the boxcar will turn onto the side track and hit the one person. The one person will be injured or killed, and so Ben would be responsible for that. It is better to let the boxcar continue on the track, even though that means nobody will be hit."

This theory holds that the morally right thing to do is the one that will produce the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. In this case, pushing the one visitor off the oxygen supply line will result in one death but will save the lives of five other people. Therefore, it is the morally right thing to do."

There are several reasons why pulling the supply line is the right thing to do. First, the one visitor who is injured can be safely evacuated by medics and will not die if he is not moved. Second, the five visitors in the underwater observation pod will die without oxygen, so restoring their oxygen supply is more important than saving the one injured visitor. Finally, even though the one visitor will die if the supply line is pulled out from under him, his death is not certain. The medics may still be able to save him, whereas the five visitors in the pod will certainly die without oxygen."

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The general form of the problem is this: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you see that there is one person on the side track. The trolley will certainly kill him. Is it morally permissible for you to pull the lever, knowing that the person on the side track will die?

Most people say that it is morally permissible to pull the lever in this case. The reason is that by doing so, you will be saving the lives of the five people on the main track. Although it is tragic that the one person on the side track will die, this is outweighed by the good of saving the five people."

This situation is a classic example of the trolley problem. In this case, it is morally wrong for Alan to do nothing, because he has the power to save the lives of five people by releasing the repairman's leg."
883,23,Why?,1,1,1,"

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics that asks whether it is morally permissible to kill one person in order to save the lives of five others. The problem is often framed as follows: there is a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people who will be killed if the trolley proceeds on its current course. You are standing next to a lever that can switch the trolley onto a different set of tracks. However, there is a person on the side track who will be killed if you switch the trolley. Is it morally permissible to kill the one person on the side track in order to save the five people on the main track?

Most people say that it is morally permissible to kill the one person on the side track in order to save the five people on the main track. This is because the death of one person is outweighed by the lives of five others."

Other people would say that Don should continue to speed towards the five swimmers, because he has a better chance of saving them. Ultimately, the decision is up to Don."
1010,26,"Don is driving his motorboat in the bay when he notices some swimmers 
 in trouble. There are five swimmers drowning at the end of a channel in front of Don. To the side of the channel there is another swimmer drowning. If Don stops to save the one swimmer on the side of the channel, he will not be able to get to the five swimmers in time to save them.

It depends on the situation. If Don has enough time to save both the one swimmer and the five swimmers, then he should save them both. However, if he does not have enough time to save both, then he should prioritize the five swimmers over the one swimmer."
1011,26,Why?,1,5,1,"

The reason is that there is a greater chance of saving more lives if he prioritizes the five swimmers. Although it is possible that all six swimmers could be saved, the likelihood of this happening is lower than if he just saves the five swimmers. Therefore, in this situation, it is more logical to prioritize the five swimmers over the one swimmer."

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The general form of the problem is this: There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, there is one person tied up on the side track. The trolley will hit and kill that person if you pull the lever. So here’s the question: Should you pull the lever and kill one person to save five?

Most people say that you should pull the lever in this case. It is better to kill one person than to kill five.
