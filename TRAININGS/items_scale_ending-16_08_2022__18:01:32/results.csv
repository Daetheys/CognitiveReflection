Question: Evan sees that an empty runaway boxcar is about to hit five 
 people working on the track ahead. They are too far away to be warned.  The only way to stop the boxcar is for it to hit something heavy. Next to Evan is a switch that can be flipped to turn the boxcar away from the five people onto a side track that loops and then rejoins the main track. One person, unaware of the boxcar, is working on this looped side track. This person, if hit, will cause the boxcar to stop before it reaches the five people on the main track.  If Evan flips the switch, the boxcar will turn onto the side track, hit the one person and therefore stop before it reaches to the five people. If Evan does not flip the switch, the boxcar will continue on the main track and hit the five people and not the one person. Flipping the switch is…

Question: Tim works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine 
 that can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death. Tim notices that the machine has pumped a near toxic amount of the chemical into a patient's body. Tim must immediately stop the machine to save the patient's life. However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients. If Tim stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Tim doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive.

Question:Bob works at a hospital. He is in charge of a machine that 
 can both increase and decrease the amount of a certain chemical in a patient's bloodstream. Too much or too little of the chemical results in death. Bob notices that the machine has pumped a near toxic amount of the chemical into a patient's body. Bob must immediately stop the machine to save the patient's life. However, he sees that five other patients with toxic amounts of the chemical are hooked up to the machine. The machine is removing the chemical from these five patients and will continue to do so only if it can maintain equilibrium by continuing to pump the chemical into the one patient. If Bob stops the machine to save the one patient, the five other patients will die. If Bob doesn’t stop the machine, the one patient will die, but the five other patients will survive.

Question:Andy is a fireman trying to help five children out of a burning

 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders.

George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.

Question:George receives a communication that the captain of a cargo ship has contracted 
 a highly infectious disease. The captain himself is only a carrier of the disease and is immune to the symptoms, but anybody who comes into contact with him will die. No passengers are on the ship. The ship is headed for a remote island where the captain will hand-deliver the cargo to the five islanders. The captain does not know that he is carrying the disease and has no radio to receive a warning.  George takes off in a helicopter to intercept the ship, but from a distance he sees the ship about to dock.  The ship is on fire, however, and the captain will be burned before the ship docks.  George could fire a missile into the water next to the ship, causing a splash that would put out the fire and save the captain. If George fires the missile the captain will live but the disease will be transmitted, killing the five islanders.  If George does not fire the missile the captain will die and the five islanders will live. Not firing the missile is…

Question:Alan is operating the switch at a railroad station when he sees an 
 empty, out of control boxcar coming down the tracks.  It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die immediately.  The boxcar is headed towards a repairman whose leg is caught in the switch. Further down the main track are five more repairmen. If Alan does nothing, the boxcar will hit the repairman and then come to a stop and none of the five workers will be threatened. Alan can pull a lever and release the repairman’s leg, allowing him to jump safely out of the way.

825,23,Why?,1,12,1,"

The question asks what Alan should do in this situation - should he pull the lever and release the repairman's leg, or should he not pull the lever and allow the boxcar to hit the repairman but not the other five workers.

There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as it depends on Alan's personal values and beliefs. If Alan believes that it is more important to save the life of the one repairman, then he should pull the lever. If Alan believes that it is more important to save the lives of the five workers, then he should not pull the lever."
