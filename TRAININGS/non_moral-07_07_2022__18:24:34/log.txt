Mrs. Santiago has a less flexible schedule and can only come in at 10:00 AM, so scheduling her for that time would work best.

You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of 
 buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

Yes, I would purchase the generic brand.
Why?

The pharmacist is someone I trust and he says it is exactly the same.

You have a headache. You go to the pharmacy with the intention of 
 buying a particular name-brand headache medicine. When you get there you discover that the pharmacy is out of the brand you were looking for.The pharmacist, whom you’ve known for a long time and in whom you have a great deal of trust, tells you that he has in stock a generic product which is, in his words, “exactly the same” as the product you had originally intended to buy. Would you purchase the generic brand instead of searching further for the name-brand product you were looking for?

It is likely that I would purchase the generic brand if the pharmacist I trust tells me that it is exactly the same.
Why?

There are a few reasons why I would be likely to purchase the generic brand in this case. First, if I have a headache, I want relief as soon as possible. If the generic brand will work just as well as the name-brand product, then it makes sense to go with the generic brand so that I can get relief more quickly. Second, I trust the pharmacist's opinion. He is a professional and he knows more about medicine than I do. If he says that the generic brand is just as good as the name-brand product, then I believe him. Third, the generic brand is usually cheaper than the name-brand product. This means that I can save money by purchasing the generic brand.

Of course, there are also some reasons why I might not purchase the generic brand in this case. For example, if I have had bad experiences with generic brands in the past, then I might not want to purchase the generic brand in this case. Or, if I am worried that the generic brand might not work as well as the name-brand product, then I might decide to search further for the name-brand product.

 diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?

Yes, I would turn the turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty.
Why?

The reason I would turn the turnip-harvesting machine to the right is because it would be more efficient. By choosing the path on the right, I would be able to harvest more turnips in a shorter amount of time.

If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?

You are a farm worker driving a turnip-harvesting machine. You are approaching two 
 diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?

Yes.
Why?

The reason is simple: it is always better to have some turnips than no turnips at all. Even though the path on the left will yield more turnips, the path on the right will still yield a respectable number of turnips. Therefore, it is better to go for the path on the right, since it is guaranteed to yield at least some turnips, rather than risk getting no turnips at all by choosing the path on the left.

 diverging paths.By choosing the path on the left you will harvest thirty bushels of turnips. By choosing the path on the right you will harvest fifteen bushels of turnips. If you do nothing your turnip-picking machine will turn to the left. Would you turn your turnip-harvesting machine to the right in order to harvest fifteen bushels of turnips instead of thirty?

No
Why?

The correct answer is that it depends on the cost of harvesting the turnips. If the cost of harvesting the turnips is the same regardless of which path is chosen, then it makes sense to harvest more turnips by choosing the path on the left. However, if the cost of harvesting the turnips is higher on the path on the left, then it make sense to turn to the path on the right in order to minimize the cost.

No, I would not have my old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one.

Third, the electronics shop next door is having a sale, so I would be able to get the new VCR for a good price. Lastly, if my old VCR breaks again, I would rather just buy a new one than have it repaired.

It would not make financial sense to have my old VCR fixed when I could buy a new one for the same price. If the new VCR is slightly better than my old one, then it would be worth it to buy the new one.

You have brought your broken VCR to the local repair shop. The woman 
 working at the shop tells you that it will cost you about $100 to have it fixed.You noticed in the paper that morning that the electronics shop next door is having a sale on VCR’s and that a certain new VCR which is slightly better than your old one is on sale for $100.Would you have your old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one?

No, I would buy the new one on sale for $100.
Why?

There are a few reasons why it makes more sense to buy the new one on sale. First, with the new one you are getting a slightly better model than the one you have. Second, you don't have to pay to have the old one fixed. Third, you can be sure that the new one will work properly since it is brand new. For these reasons, it makes more sense to buy the new one on sale.

No, I would not have my old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one.
Why?

The reason is that it would be more cost effective in the long run to just buy the new VCR. Even though it may cost $100 to have the old one fixed, that money could be put towards the purchase of the new one. In addition, the new VCR would likely be more reliable and have more features than the old one.

Yes, I would have my old VCR fixed.
Why?

There are several reasons why I would have my old VCR fixed rather than buying a new one. First, my old VCR probably still has some life left in it and so it would be a waste to get rid of it. Second, even though the new VCR is slightly better, it is not worth spending an extra $100 on when my old VCR can be fixed for the same price. Finally, repairing my old VCR will likely be cheaper in the long run since I will not have to pay for a new warranty or for any new accessories that I might need with a new VCR.

Why?

There are several reasons why I would have my old VCR fixed in order to avoid spending money on a new one. First, even though the new VCR may be slightly better than my old one, it is not likely that the difference in quality would be significant enough to justify the cost of buying a new one. Second, my old VCR probably has sentimental value to me and I may be attached to it in a way that I would not be attached to a new one. Finally, repairing my old VCR is likely to be less expensive than buying a new one, even if the repair costs $100.

Second, even if the repair shop did a good job, there is no guarantee that the VCR would work for very long before breaking again. Third, newer models of VCR’s are likely to have better features than my old one, so it would be worth it to spend the extra money on a new one.

Second, my old VCR may have sentimental value to me and I may not want to get rid of it. Third, repair shops usually have a warranty or guarantee on their work, so if something goes wrong with my old VCR after I get it fixed, I can take it back to the repair shop and get it fixed for free.

Yes.
Why?

There are a few reasons why it would make sense to have the old VCR fixed in this scenario. First of all, $100 is a significant amount of money, and it may be difficult or impossible to come up with that much money for a new VCR.

Finally, the old VCR may have sentimental value, so it may be worth repairing it even if it is not the most technologically advanced option.

No, I would not have my old VCR fixed.
Why?

There are a few reasons why. First, even though the repair shop says it will cost around $100 to fix my old VCR, there is no guarantee that is the final cost. The repair shop could find additional problems with my VCR once they begin working on it and the final cost could be much higher than $100. Second, the VCR on sale at the electronics shop next door is a newer model and is slightly better than my old one, so it makes more sense to just buy the new one instead of fixing the old one. Finally, even though I would have to spend $100 on the new VCR, it would likely last longer than my old VCR would if I had it repaired, so it is a better investment in the long run.

You have been offered employment by two different fi rms, and you are 
 trying to decide which offer to accept.Firm A has offered you an annual salary of $100,000 and fourteen days of vacation per year. Firm B has offered you an annual salary of $50,000 and sixteen days of vacation per year. The two fi rms and the two positions are otherwise very similar.Is it appropriate for you to take Firm B’s offer in order to have two more days of vacation per year?

No, it is not appropriate to take Firm B's offer in order to have two more days of vacation per year.
Why?

The reason is that, in general, it is not appropriate to make employment decisions based solely on the number of vacation days per year. While two additional days of vacation may be desirable, there are other factors that should be considered when making a decision about which firm to work for, such as salary, job responsibilities, company culture, location, and so on.

No, it is not appropriate for you to take Firm B's offer in order to have two more days of vacation per year.
Why?

The main reason is that Firm A's offer is much higher in terms of salary. This means that, overall, Firm A is likely to provide more compensation than Firm B. Two additional days of vacation per year is not likely to make up for the significant difference in salary.

Why?

The two firms and the two positions are otherwise very similar, so the main factor to consider here is the salary. Firm A is offering a salary that is double that of Firm B, so it is the better option. Two more days of vacation per year is not worth a $50,000 salary difference.

While it is difficult to make a definitive statement without knowing more about the two firms and the positions being offered, in general it is probably not appropriate to take Firm B's offer in order to have two more days of vacation per year. Two extra days of vacation per year is a relatively small benefit compared to an annual salary that is $50,000 higher. Therefore, it is likely that there are other factors that should be considered when making a decision about which firm to accept employment with.
Why?

The main reason why it is probably not appropriate to take Firm B's offer in order to have two more days of vacation per year is that the salary offered by Firm A is significantly higher. An annual salary of $100,000 is $50,000 higher than an annual salary of $50,000, which is a significant difference. Therefore, it is likely that there are other factors that should be considered when making a decision about which firm to accept employment with.
