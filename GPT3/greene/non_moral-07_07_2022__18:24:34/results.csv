There are a few reasons why I would be likely to purchase the generic brand in this case. First, if I have a headache, I want relief as soon as possible. If the generic brand will work just as well as the name-brand product, then it makes sense to go with the generic brand so that I can get relief more quickly. Second, I trust the pharmacist's opinion. He is a professional and he knows more about medicine than I do. If he says that the generic brand is just as good as the name-brand product, then I believe him. Third, the generic brand is usually cheaper than the name-brand product. This means that I can save money by purchasing the generic brand.

Of course, there are also some reasons why I might not purchase the generic brand in this case. For example, if I have had bad experiences with generic brands in the past, then I might not want to purchase the generic brand in this case. Or, if I am worried that the generic brand might not work as well as the name-brand product, then I might decide to search further for the name-brand product."
